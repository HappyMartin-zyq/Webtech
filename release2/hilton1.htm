            Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, formerly The Waldorf=Astoria Collection,[2] is a luxury hotel and resort brand of Hilton Worldwide. It is positioned as the flagship brand within Hilton's portfolio, being used on hotels which offer the highest standards of facilities and service. As of December 31, 2019, it had 32 locations with 9,821 rooms in 15 countries and territories, including 2 that are owned or leased (with 463 rooms) and 30 that are managed (with 9,358 rooms).[1]

        <div id="panel">In January 2006, Hilton Hotels Corporation announced that it would launch a luxury hotel chain called The Waldorf Astoria Collection, branded after its flagship Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City.[2] In 2014, this property was sold to Anbang Insurance, while Hilton still manages the hotel under its brand.[3] Some of Hilton's properties carry the "Waldorf" name in their title but are not part of the Waldorf Astoria chain – an example is The Waldorf Hilton, London.

            By April 2007, the chain had four properties – the flagship hotel in New York, the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix, La Quinta Resort & Spa in La Quinta, California, and the Grand Wailea Resort & Spa in Wailea, Maui, Hawaii.
            
            Later in 2007, the Qasr Al Sharq in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was added to the portfolio. The next property to join the portfolio was the Rome Cavalieri, a rebranding and upgrading of the Cavalieri Hilton in Rome, Italy, in early summer 2008. During the fall of 2008, three Florida hotels, located in Boca Raton, Key West and Naples, were also added.
            
            In July 2009, the Dakota Mountain Lodge opened in Park City, Utah; it later dropped the "Dakota Mountain Lodge" title and is now known simply as Waldorf Astoria Park City. It is the first ski resort to join the portfolio.[4]
            
            In January 2014, the Waldorf Astoria Dubai Palm Jumeirah opened in Dubai, on the Palm Jumeirah.[5] In March 2014, the Waldorf Astoria Beijing opened its doors. On May 1, 2014, the Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam received its first guests.
            
            In October 2014, Hilton Worldwide announced the sale of the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel to Chinese firm Anbang Insurance Group for $1.95 billion. The Hilton group continues to operate the hotel under a 100-year management contract with the buyer.[6]
            
            In January 2017, the Waldorf Astoria Dubai complained about Russian models taking erotic pictures in the hotel and posting them on Instagram with hashtags mentioning the hotel.[7][8]
            
            In February 2018, Hilton announced that it will open Africa's first Waldorf Astoria in Cairo's Heliopolis district. The hotel is scheduled to be completed before the end of 2018.[9]
