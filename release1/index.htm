<!--
    In the proposal, I want to include personal opinions and service of the hotel. however, I found that the service for those hotel are mostly the same. Hence, in the release 1, I would like to change it to the description and the history of the hotels.
    In the Marriott.htm and hilton.htm, there are tables in the middle of the website.
    There are drop down menu on the top left of all pages, which contains a bulleted or numbered list with one or more indented sub-lists.
    In the index.htm page, the first image contains an image map with two hot spots.(the top half of the image will direct to Hilton wiki, the bottom half will direct to Marriott wiki)
    there is a youtube video embedded in the hilton.htm
    In the bottom of the index.htm page, there is an audio play menu.
